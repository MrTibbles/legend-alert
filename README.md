<h1 align="center">Legend Alert</h1>

_Apex Legends player stats tracker_


## Job Stories
_"When a new user opens Legend Alert, they want to be able to input their platform and player tag, so they can view how much of an absolute legend they are."_

_"When a returning user opens Legend Alert, they do not want to have input their information again, so they can quickly view their legendary status."_

_"When a user is viewing their player stats, they want the information to be as up-to-date as possible, so they can be assured they are still a total legend."_

_"When a user is actively playing Apex Legends, they want to be able to check the stats of a gun quickly, so they know whether or not to pick it up."_
